<p>Aggregated data is considered Non-Personal Information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. If we do combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information the combined information will be treated as Personal Information and shall be subject to the provisions of a customer service agreement and this Privacy Policy Statement for as long as it remains combined.</p>

<p><strong>Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information Under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR</strong>)</p>
<p>If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), CID&rsquo;s legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Information we collect and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>

<p>CID may process your Personal Information because:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>We need to contact you or provide a Consulting Service involving you.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>You have given us permission to do so;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The processing is in our legitimate interests, and it is not overridden by your rights; or</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>To comply with the law.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Retention of Data</strong></p>
<p>CID will retain your Personal Information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes of Consulting Services or as set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your Personal Information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>

<p>CID will also retain data collected automatically either generated by the use of the Website or from the Website infrastructure itself (collectively, &ldquo;<em><strong>Usage Data</strong></em>&rdquo;) for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of the Website, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.</p>

<p>The means, processes, policies, or other reasonable measures employed by CID for the secure retention, storage, and management of Personal Information obtained through Consulting Services are detailed in the CID Information Security and Business Continuity Program.</p>

<p><strong>Transfer of Data</strong></p>
<p>Your information, including Personal Information, may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers and/or servers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.</p>

<p>If you are located outside of the United States of America and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Information, to the United States of America and process it there.</p>

<p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>

<p>CID employs reasonably necessary and industry accepted measures to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy; and that your Personal Information will not knowingly be transferred to an organization, country, or other party without reasonable controls in place meant to ensure security of your data and other personal information.</p>
<p>The means, processes, policies, or other reasonable measures employed by CID for the secure transfer of Usage Data or other Personal Information are detailed in the CID Information Security and Business Continuity Program.</p>

<p><strong>Disclosure for Law Enforcement</strong></p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, CID may be required to disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).</p>
<p><strong>Legal Requirements</strong></p>
<p>CID may disclose your Personal Information in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>To comply with a legal obligation;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>To protect and defend the rights or property of CID;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>To prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with our Website or Consulting Services;</p>
    </li>

        <p>To protect the personal safety of users of the Website or participants in the Consulting Services or the public; or</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>To protect against legal liability.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security of Data</strong></p>
<p>The security of your data is of principal importance to us but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>The means, processes, policies, and other reasonable measures employed by CID to secure Personal Information are detailed in the CID Information Security and Business Continuity Program.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page, or by other means, and will update the &ldquo;effective date&rdquo; set forth below in this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective the latest posted revision date.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy was last updated and revised on July 20, 2023.</p>

<p><strong>California Residents &ndash; Your Privacy Rights Pertaining to Personal Information Provided via the Website</strong></p>

<p>A California resident who has provided Personal Information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (&ldquo;<em><strong>California customer</strong></em>&rdquo;) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed Personal Information to any third parties for the third parties&rsquo; direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of Personal Information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third-parties to whom Personal Information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of Personal Information that were disclosed.</p>

<p>However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy statement) a policy of not disclosing customer&rsquo;s Personal Information to third-parties unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of Personal Information and providing a cost-free means to exercise that right.</p>

<p>As stated in our privacy policy statement, you should always review the privacy policies and practices of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will manage your information.</p>

<p>California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by <u>contacting us&nbsp;</u><u><a href="mailto:rmallard@hr-catalyst.com?subject=Inquiry%20Submitted%20from%20CID%20Privacy%20Statement%20Link">here</a></u>. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through the point of contact linked above.</p>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The right to receive requested information in a readily usable format if provided electronically;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The right to request that we delete any Personal Information about the Resident Employee that we have collected (although we may be entitled to retain some information for certain purposes); you may exercise this right by <u>contacting us&nbsp;</u><u><a href="mailto:rmallard@hr-catalyst.com?subject=Inquiry%20Submitted%20from%20CID%20Privacy%20Statement%20Link">here</a></u>;</p>
